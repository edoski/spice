# Configuration

SPICE config is a flat set of named YAML specs under [src/spice/conf](src/spice/conf).
The resolver uses PyYAML plus Pydantic models; there is no Hydra or OmegaConf layer.

## Surfaces

`surface/*.yaml` is durable benchmark context. A surface names stable specs and explicit workflow-section refs:

```yaml
chain: ethereum
dataset: icdcs_2026
provider: publicnode
problem: current_row_nominal_window
dataset_builder: fixed_context_temporal
prediction: icdcs_2026
acquisition: default
training: default
split: default
tuning: default
model: lstm
tuning_space: lstm_fixed_context
feature_set: same_block_closed_full
objective: profit_poisson_replay_2h
evaluation: poisson_replay_2h
delay_seconds: 36
```

Canonical mechanism surfaces:

- `same_block_closed`: paper-faithful unsafe same-block closed path.
- `block_open_lagged`: safe current-row sibling with lagged finalized block facts.

`model`, `feature_set`, `objective`, `evaluation`, `tuning_space`, `delay_seconds`, `study`, `variant`, and `trial_count` may be supplied by benchmark cases or CLI overrides when a surface leaves variation to the run request.

## Workflow Refs

Workflow sections are named refs, not inline blocks:

- `acquisition/default.yaml`
- `training/default.yaml`
- `split/default.yaml`
- `tuning/default.yaml`

Add a new named ref only when behavior differs. Small run variation should normally live in benchmark cases or CLI flags.

## CLI Fields

Workflow commands use `--surface`. `--preset` is intentionally unsupported.

Common selectors include `--chain`, `--problem`, `--feature-set`, `--objective`, `--evaluation`, `--model`, `--tuning-space`, `--training`, `--split`, `--tuning`, `--study`, `--variant`, `--delay-seconds`, and `--trial-count`. `acquire` also accepts `--acquisition` and `--dry-run`.

Resolution order:

1. load the surface
2. load referenced typed specs
3. apply CLI or benchmark case overrides
4. validate the final workflow config
5. derive storage identity from the resolved config

Storage identity does not include the surface or benchmark name. It changes when resolved semantic payloads such as model, objective, feature set, problem, training, split, tuning, or tuning space change.

## Benchmarks

`benchmark/*.yaml` is experiment-batch shorthand. Each case expands into concrete workflow commands. `workflow` is scalar per case. List-valued fields expand cartesian within that case, and paired or irregular axes should be separate cases.

```yaml
cases:
  - surface: block_open_lagged
    workflow: evaluate
    model: lstm
    tuning_space: lstm_fixed_context
    feature_set: block_open_lagged_calendar_only_time
    objective: profit_poisson_replay_2h
    evaluation: poisson_replay_2h
    delay_seconds: [12, 24, 36]
    study: safe_lstm_direct
    variant: baseline
```

Expansion validates every row before printing anything:

```bash
spice benchmark expand safe_delay_sensitivity
```

V1 only prints shell-safe commands. It does not submit jobs, schedule dependencies, maintain ledgers, or run heartbeat logic.
