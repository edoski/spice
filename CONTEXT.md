# Spice

Spice is a temporal fee-decision research pipeline for EVM chains. This context names the project concepts used when config selections become executable workflow configs.

## Language

**Surface**:
A named recipe that groups default config choices for one workflow family.
_Avoid_: preset, profile

**Workflow Selection**:
Unresolved workflow intent made of a surface plus optional overrides.
_Avoid_: request

**Root Consumer Selection**:
Explicit existing-root id intent for a workflow or action that reads an existing corpus, study, or artifact.
_Avoid_: config echo, fuzzy selector

**Storage Operator Outcome**:
Renderable result produced by storage-owned show/delete command logic for an existing persisted root.
_Avoid_: CLI storage policy, print helper result

The concrete local-spec config type selected by an owner id and safe for owner coercers to preserve by identity.
_Avoid_: selector base config, typed payload

**Resolved Workflow Hydration**:
Config module that turns a raw Resolved Workflow Snapshot back into a typed train, tune, or evaluate Workflow Config through owner coercers, without re-resolving a Surface.
_Avoid_: workflow config coercion, surface replay

**Resolved Workflow Snapshot**:
Durable JSON payload for a resolved train, tune, or evaluate Workflow Config, loaded through owner coercers without re-resolving surfaces.
_Avoid_: config dump, hydrated request

**Config Group**:
A named collection of YAML specs for one kind of selectable configuration.

One durable benchmark plan with local run-state files for metadata, plan, submission, and collection snapshot.

## Example Dialogue

> **Dev:** "Should the benchmark create temporary YAML files for every lookback window?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The benchmark builds a **Workflow Selection** with an inline **Problem Spec**, then config resolution produces the **Workflow Config**."

## Flagged Ambiguities

- "request" previously meant unresolved workflow intent. Use **Workflow Selection** for that concept.
