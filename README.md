# SPICE Temporal Baseline

Practical reproduction scaffold for the temporal module described in `ICDCS_2026.pdf`.
This repository intentionally reproduces the paper's temporal module only, not the
full SPICE framework.

## Scope

- Build chain-local datasets from raw block data.
- Train baseline LSTM, Transformer, and Transformer-LSTM models.
- Evaluate training diagnostics on pre-evaluation history and paper-comparable temporal profit on the evaluation day.
- Predict the minimum-cost execution block inside a bounded future window rather than forecasting the full future fee trajectory.
- Prepare a later handoff to chain-specific hyperparameter optimization.
- Exclude spatial routing, token-price routing, oracle integration, and distributed reputation.

## Architecture

- `config.py`: typed experiment, training, and chain configuration.
- `api.py`: the supported high-level Python API for training and simulation workflows.
- `contracts.py`: typed boundary contracts for raw rows, tensor batches, and model outputs.
- `env.py`: local `.env` loading.
- `cryo.py`: cryo pull planning and execution.
- `_rpc.py`: internal generic JSON-RPC client used to hydrate missing `gas_limit`.
- `rpc_providers.py`: standalone RPC provider registry for direct URLs and hosted providers.
- `io.py` and `enrich.py`: block-dataset loading plus `gas_limit` enrichment for cryo output.
- `features.py`, `datasets.py`, and `normalization.py`: feature engineering, array-backed temporal dataset stores, chronological split indices, and exact train-only scaling over overlapping windows.
- `models.py`, `torch_datasets.py`, `training.py`, and `evaluation.py`: PyTorch models, lazy sequence slicing, training loop, inverse-frequency class weighting, and ratio-of-sums economic metrics.
- `pipeline.py`: training-dataset preparation, inference-dataset preparation, and one-run model training.
- `artifacts.py`: canonical training artifact manifest plus model save/load helpers.
- `reporting.py`: structured JSON report artifacts for training and simulation runs.
- `simulation.py`: paper-style evaluation-day temporal simulation.
- `cli.py`: Typer entrypoints for `blocks ...`, `train`, and `simulate`.

## Recommended environment

- Python 3.11 or 3.12 for the most predictable PyTorch support.
- Apple Silicon is supported through the PyTorch MPS backend.
- Define `RPC_PROVIDER` in a local `.env` to select a provider such as `direct`, `alchemy`,
  or `publicnode`.
- For `direct`, define per-chain URLs such as `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`, `POLYGON_RPC_URL`,
  and `AVALANCHE_RPC_URL`.
- For `alchemy`, define `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`.
- `publicnode` currently requires no additional secrets.

## Planned workflow

1. Pull raw block data with `cryo`.
2. Enrich missing block fields if needed.
3. Build supervised datasets with fixed lookback and bounded delay budgets, where action `0` means next-block execution and action `k` means waiting `k` extra blocks.
4. Train models that choose the minimum-cost block inside the admissible future window, rather than attempting to forecast the full future fee curve.
5. Train the 27-model baseline matrix into canonical artifact directories.
6. Run evaluation-day temporal simulations from persisted artifacts.
7. Start chain-specific HPO only after the baseline matrix is verified.

## First pilot

Use the dedicated pilot config to validate the full raw-data-to-training-and-simulation path before larger pulls:

1. `python -m spice_temporal.cli blocks pull configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml ethereum history --no-dry-run`
2. `python -m spice_temporal.cli blocks enrich configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml ethereum artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/raw/ethereum/history artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/history`
3. `python -m spice_temporal.cli blocks pull configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml ethereum evaluation --no-dry-run`
4. `python -m spice_temporal.cli blocks enrich configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml ethereum artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/raw/ethereum/evaluation artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/evaluation`
5. `python -m spice_temporal.cli train configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/history artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/runs/ethereum/lstm-36s ethereum lstm 36`
6. `python -m spice_temporal.cli simulate configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/runs/ethereum/lstm-36s artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/history artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/evaluation`

The first pilot target is `Ethereum + 36s + LSTM`, using fixed chain block times and a 36-second maximum additional delay budget over next-block execution.

Training writes a canonical artifact directory containing:

- `artifact.json`: model and dataset contract metadata
- `model.pt`: trained model weights
- `train_report.json`: supervised training/test diagnostics
- `simulation_report.json`: paper-comparable evaluation-day temporal metrics

## Verification

- `ruff check src tests`
- `pyright`
- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q`

Run verification inside a dedicated `.venv` with project dependencies installed.

## Python API

The only supported Python API surface is [`spice_temporal.api`](/Users/edo/Documents/Obsidian/the-vault/university/Thesis/spice-temporal-baseline/src/spice_temporal/api.py).

```python
from pathlib import Path

from spice_temporal.api import load_artifact, load_config, run_simulation_workflow, run_training_workflow

config = load_config(Path("configs/pilots/ethereum-36s.yaml"))
train_report = run_training_workflow(
    config,
    Path("artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/history"),
    Path("artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/runs/ethereum/lstm-36s"),
    "ethereum",
    "lstm",
    36,
)
artifact = load_artifact(Path("artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/runs/ethereum/lstm-36s"))
simulation_report = run_simulation_workflow(
    config,
    Path("artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/runs/ethereum/lstm-36s"),
    Path("artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/history"),
    Path("artifacts/pilots/ethereum-36s/enriched/ethereum/evaluation"),
)
```

Lower-level modules remain internal implementation details and may change without notice.
