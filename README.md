# SPICE

SPICE is a temporal fee-timing pipeline for EVM chains. It acquires canonical block corpora, builds resolved feature tables through registered feature families, tunes models, trains artifacts, and runs evaluation-day simulations under real delay budgets.

## Stack

- `Typer` for the root CLI
- `Pydantic` + `PyYAML` for explicit config loading
- `SQLAlchemy Core` for SPICE-owned structured state
- `sf-hamilton` for feature/dataflow execution
- `Lightning` + `PyTorch` for training
- `Optuna` for tuning and study persistence
- `web3.py` for RPC access
- `Polars` + `Pandera` for block-table validation and corpus IO

## Setup

```bash
brew install uv
uv sync --extra dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`uv` manages the repo-local `.venv/`. If you do not want to activate it, prefix commands with `uv run`.

Provider credentials:

- `direct`: export `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`, `POLYGON_RPC_URL`, `AVALANCHE_RPC_URL`
- `alchemy`: export `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`

## CLI

Everything runs through one command with explicit flags:

```bash
spice acquire --preset icdcs_2026
spice acquire --preset icdcs_2026 --chain avalanche --provider publicnode
spice train --preset icdcs_2026 --model lstm --feature-set icdcs_2026
spice tune --preset icdcs_2026 --model lstm --feature-set icdcs_2026 --trial-count 20
spice simulate --preset icdcs_2026 --variant baseline
spice config list provider
spice config show dataset icdcs_2026
spice config create chain my_chain --set runtime.chain_id=123 --set runtime.uses_poa_extra_data=false
spice config update provider direct --set chains.my_chain.endpoint.env_var=MY_CHAIN_RPC_URL
spice config delete preset old_preset
spice show dataset
spice show artifact --chain avalanche --dataset icdcs_2026 --model lstm --problem icdcs_2026 --variant baseline
spice show study --chain avalanche --dataset icdcs_2026 --model lstm --problem icdcs_2026 --study default
spice show study --chain avalanche --dataset icdcs_2026 --model lstm --problem icdcs_2026 --study default --detail config
spice delete artifact --chain avalanche --dataset icdcs_2026 --model lstm --problem icdcs_2026 --variant baseline
```

Override files stay plain YAML:

```bash
spice train --preset icdcs_2026 --config local/train.yaml
```

## Config

Config loading lives in [src/spice/config](src/spice/config).

Named specs live under [src/spice/conf](src/spice/conf):

- `preset/`: convenience bundles of named selectors
- `dataset/`: evaluation-date selectors
- `chain/`, `provider/`: chain and RPC specs
- `problem/`, `execution/`: delay budgets and sampling contracts in real seconds
- `model/`, `feature_set/`: modeling choices
- `training/`, `split/`, `simulation/`, `acquisition/`, `tuning/`, `tuning_space/`: workflow profiles

Core spec authoring goes through `spice config`:

- `spice config list <group>`
- `spice config show <group> <name>`
- `spice config create <group> <name> --set path=value ...`
- `spice config update <group> <name> --set path=value ... --unset path ...`
- `spice config delete <group> <name> [--force]`

Rules:

- Presets are optional. They are not the canonical schema.
- `spice config` writes canonical YAML into `src/spice/conf/<group>/<name>.yaml`.
- `problem.lookback_seconds` and `problem.max_supported_delay_seconds` are real wall-clock contracts.
- `problem.compiler.id` selects the temporal compiler.
- `feature_set.family.id` selects the feature family.
- Feature prerequisites are derived from the selected feature graph as `history_seconds` and `warmup_rows`.
- `acquire` expands raw history until the selected problem and feature graph produce enough valid anchor samples.
- `train` and `simulate` validate that the selected feature graph matches the trained artifact.
- Prediction semantics are explicit config now. Shipped presets select a prediction family through `prediction.family.id`.

## Temporal Semantics

Public interfaces stay seconds-native:

- `lookback_seconds`
- `max_supported_delay_seconds`
- `requested_delay_seconds`

Internal semantics go through a problem-local compiler:

- `timestamp_native`: context and candidates come from real timestamp windows
- `estimated_block`: seconds are lowered into corpus-calibrated block geometry

The shipped `icdcs_2026` path uses `estimated_block` plus the `block_native` feature family.
The `time_native` family remains available as an alternate path.

## Prediction Semantics

Prediction semantics are family-owned under `src/spice/prediction/`.

Shipped families:

- `candidate_offset_selection`
  - one-head offset selection over the candidate slate
  - primary training and tuning metric: `profit_over_baseline`
- `min_block_fee_multitask`
  - paper-faithful offset classification plus min-fee regression
  - primary training and tuning metric: `total_loss`

Replay remains economic for both families:

- `profit_over_baseline`
- `cost_over_optimum`
- `baseline_cost_over_optimum`

The shipped `icdcs_2026` preset now targets the paper path with `prediction: icdcs_2026_paper`.
`icdcs_2026_offset_selection` remains available as the alternate current-family preset.

## Output Layout

- catalog: `outputs/.spice/catalog.sqlite`
- history corpus: `outputs/corpora/<chain>/<corpus_id>/history/...`
- evaluation corpus: `outputs/corpora/<chain>/<corpus_id>/evaluation/...`
- corpus state: `outputs/corpora/<chain>/<corpus_id>/.spice/state.sqlite`
- tuned study state: `outputs/studies/<chain>/<study_id>/.spice/state.sqlite`
- model artifacts: `outputs/artifacts/<chain>/<artifact_id>/...`
- artifact state: `outputs/artifacts/<chain>/<artifact_id>/.spice/state.sqlite`

`outputs/` is the default root. Override it only when you want isolation somewhere else.

Users query by selectors such as `--dataset`, `--study`, `--model`, `--problem`, and `--variant`.
`dataset` is the public selector word. Internally the raw block collection is a `corpus`.
Storage ids are deterministic internal ids. The catalog maps selectors to roots.
Structured state is SQLite-only. SPICE does not persist generated JSON metadata or report files.
Re-running `spice tune` with the same study resumes that study up to the requested total `--trial-count`.
Study and artifact identity include the full `prediction` payload, so changing prediction semantics produces distinct stored outputs.

## Current Model Boundary

Canonical internal truth is:

- raw block corpus
- resolved feature table
- compiled problem store

Current sequence families share one semantic input representation:

- `lstm`
- `transformer`
- `transformer_lstm`

That shared representation is compiled into a masked/padded batch only at the model boundary.
The current shared sequence batch contains only model inputs:

- `inputs`
- `input_mask`

Prediction-family targets are compiled separately and attached after representation preparation.

Economic references such as optimum index, baseline fee, and realized fee are derived by the objective package from that candidate slate. They are not persisted as separate batch payload.

Future model families can register a different input representation without changing corpus storage, problem semantics, or workflow interfaces.

## Inspection and State

`spice show` is a read-only query command over stored state roots:

- catalog lookup resolves selectors to one or more roots
- typed state loaders reconstruct corpus, study, or artifact summaries
- typed root descriptions are rendered into console sections

SPICE does not route `show` through workflow config loading. It is a selector-driven inspection path over already-materialized state.

## Verification

```bash
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run pyright
uv run pytest -q
```
