# Acquisition Architecture

## Purpose

`acquisition` owns data collection mechanics. It turns block-window intent into canonical block rows that Corpus Assembly can materialize as raw corpus data.

## Theory

Training quality begins with data provenance. Raw acquisition must keep enough metadata to answer: which chain, which provider, which time windows, which blocks, and which validation status produced this corpus.

## Boundaries

Acquisition does not define ML targets, train models, score predictions, or publish corpus roots. It gathers canonical data and reports runtime facts. Corpus Assembly decides how fetched rows become a corpus root.

## Invariants

Raw block rows must be canonical before persistence. Provider-specific transport details stay in provider-specific modules. Storage commit mechanics stay behind Corpus Assembly and storage lifecycle primitives.

## Extension Points

Add a new acquisition Adapter by keeping transport, provider client, and canonical row conversion separate. Preserve the same corpus contract so features and temporal compilers remain unchanged.

## Data Flow

```text
AcquireConfig
    |
    v
provider/chain endpoint
    |
    v
block range plans
    |
    v
block source fetch
    |
    v
canonical block rows
    |
    v
Corpus Assembly
```

## Beginner Context

The model eventually trains on examples, but examples are only as trustworthy as the raw data underneath them. Acquisition is where external uncertainty enters the system: RPC latency, provider failures, missing blocks, and chain-specific payload shape. That uncertainty should be resolved before feature construction starts.

## Separation From Workflows

The acquisition package should answer "how do I fetch and canonicalize blocks?" Corpus Assembly answers "which windows do I fetch, how do I validate them, and how do I commit the result?" The acquire workflow stays a thin caller.
