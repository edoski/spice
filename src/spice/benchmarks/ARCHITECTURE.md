# Benchmark Architecture

## Purpose

`benchmarks` owns checked-in benchmark specs, dependency-aware plan materialization, durable run-state files, remote submission orchestration, all-or-nothing collection, SQLite indexing, read-only queries, and CSV export.

The benchmark domain should not live under config. It uses config resolution, but its own concepts are benchmark cases, steps, runs, submissions, collections, and result rows.

## Flow

```text
benchmark YAML spec
    |
    v
Benchmark Plan Materialization
    |
    v
Benchmark Plan Entries
    |
    v
durable run dir: metadata.json + plan.jsonl
    |
    v
submit persisted plan -> submission.jsonl
    |
    v
collect all expected evaluate results -> collection.json
    |
    v
results.sqlite projection -> CSV export/query
```

**Benchmark Plan Materialization** expands dimensions, asks the benchmark ledger materializer to normalize dependency/root policy, calls normal workflow resolution, and produces durable plan entries with resolved workflow snapshots. Inline problem grids produce inline `ProblemSpec` values during materialization; the selection ledger stores the selected problem id, while the resolved workflow config stores the full executable problem.

## Root Ledger

The root ledger is benchmark audit state, not storage catalog state. Each plan entry stores typed materialized root entries with `run_id`, workflow, role, root kind, root id, optional source run id, and root-specific ids. Roles are `consumed`, `produced`, and `source`; root kinds are `dataset`, `study`, and `artifact`.

The benchmark ledger materializer owns the required order: prepare dependency-derived selection, resolve the workflow config, finalize the root ledger from resolved config identity, then record produced roots for later dependent steps. Tuned train steps can consume a study produced by a prior tune step. Evaluate steps can consume an artifact produced by a prior train step, while separately recording the artifact-source dataset.

```

## Boundaries

Run dirs are canonical benchmark audit state. `results.sqlite` is a rebuildable projection over `collection.json`; normalized observation, metric, and root-ledger tables are the read model for list/export, while JSON payloads remain audit/debug payloads. CSV files are named export artifacts for concrete table, figure, appendix, or analysis inputs and are overwritten from the index.

`runs.py` is the public run-state facade. Benchmark run-state JSON/JSONL encoding stays benchmark-local and must not move into config or shared storage codecs.

The CLI creates run dirs, submits existing run dirs, collects existing run dirs, exports CSV, and reads the result index. It does not re-plan during submit or collect.

Remote transfer during collection uses an execution-owned `StorageTransferTransaction`; matching uses a **Benchmark Collection Resolver**. Collection builds a `BenchmarkCollectionSelection` from the plan entry and submission, asks the transaction for the selected local artifact record, then passes that record to the resolver. The resolver reads `artifact_record.state_db_path`, validates artifact identity, matches `(evaluator_id, delay_seconds, execution_ref)`, rejects stale or missing execution provenance, and does not re-resolve the local catalog.

Benchmark JSON shapes are operator-facing. Keep them stable unless a field name is part of a deliberate terminology cleanup.
