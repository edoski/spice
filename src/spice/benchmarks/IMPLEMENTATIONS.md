# Benchmark Implementations

## Benchmark Plan Materialization

`plan_benchmark()` turns a named benchmark into durable benchmark plan entries. It resolves once. Submit and collect consume persisted run-state files and do not re-plan.

Materialization keeps three ledgers distinct:

- `BenchmarkDependencyLedger` owns matched local run ids, external Slurm dependencies, and the `artifact_from` source run id.
- `BenchmarkSelectionLedger` owns benchmark coordinate intent such as surface, chain, model, problem, objective, evaluation, runtime knobs, and inline problem ids. It does not carry consumed root ids.
- `BenchmarkRootLedger` owns typed materialized root entries for consumed, produced, and source roots.

The root ledger owns dependency-derived root policy. Tuned train steps without an explicit `study_id` consume the produced study id from a prior tune dependency. Evaluate steps with `artifact_from` consume the produced artifact id from the referenced train step. Evaluate dataset selection stays explicit when provided; otherwise it inherits the artifact source dataset. Explicit tuned train studies still resolve their dataset through the storage catalog. The persisted plan field is `root_ledger`; it contains root entries, not scattered consumed/produced scalar buckets.

`plan.jsonl` stores the typed ledgers plus a Resolved Workflow Snapshot. Raw JSON validation stays in `run_state_codec.py`; materialization works with typed benchmark and workflow objects.

## Result Index

Benchmark run dirs remain the audit source of truth. `results.sqlite` is a rebuildable projection over `collection.json`.

Collection snapshots copy the typed dependency, selection, and root ledgers from the plan entry. Result index rows read normalized coordinates from typed fields, not from raw payload JSON. Artifact dataset identity and evaluation dataset identity are stored separately so cross-corpus evaluation remains inspectable. The index also projects `benchmark_root_ledger` rows keyed by observation so root audit state can be queried without decoding payload JSON.

## Collection Resolver

Collection selection is explicit. `BenchmarkCollectionSelection` is built from one evaluate plan entry and its submission record, validates run id/workflow/config/root-ledger consistency, and carries the artifact id, evaluation dataset id, evaluator id, configured delay, storage root, and submitted execution ref.

The resolver consumes a pulled artifact root. It validates that the pulled local catalog record and loaded artifact manifest match the selected artifact id, then matches evaluation summaries by evaluator id, resolved delay, and exact execution provenance. Missing matching summaries return `None` so collection can fail all-or-nothing; stale or duplicate provenance raises an operator error.
