# Concrete Config Specs

Checked-in YAML specs define runnable experiments without Python edits. A surface is the named workflow composition; benchmarks are matrix/DAG wrappers over surfaces and overrides. These specs are current runnable architecture only; historical removed benchmark matrices and estimated-block paths are documented in top-level `ARCHIVE.md`.

## Default Surface

`current_row_fee_dynamics` resolves:

```yaml
chain: ethereum
corpus: icdcs_2026
features: core_fee_dynamics
problem: current_row_nominal
model: lstm
prediction: icdcs_2026
acquisition: {provider: publicnode}
training: {id: default, split: default}
tuning: {id: default, space: lstm_fixed_context}
evaluations: null
```

Producer workflow selections may override surface fields by name. Evaluation is a root consumer: it selects an existing artifact and corpus by id, plus evaluator/runtime controls.

The surface YAML uses targeted nesting where the nesting matches ownership:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `chain` | Chain spec used for runtime chain id, POA handling, and nominal block time. |
| `corpus` | Acquired block-range spec. |
| `features` | Feature catalog/output spec. |
| `problem` | Temporal problem spec. |
| `model` | Model family config. |
| `prediction` | Prediction head/decoder semantics. |
| `acquisition.provider` | RPC provider spec. Provider YAML owns endpoint and acquisition runtime settings. |
| `training.id` | Training hyperparameter spec. |
| `training.split` | Split spec. |
| `tuning.id` | Optuna runtime spec. |
| `tuning.space` | Tuning search-space spec. |
| `evaluations` | Optional reusable suite of named evaluation windows. |

## Current Specs

Chains: `ethereum`, `polygon`, `avalanche`.

Providers: `publicnode`, `tenderly`.

Corpus: `icdcs_2026`.

Features: `core_fee_dynamics` is the canonical no-priority safe catalog. `core_fee_dynamics_with_priority_fee` adds lagged priority-fee scalars and p50/spread local trends. `core_fee_dynamics_elapsed_position` is the elapsed-position ablation catalog; it is identical to `core_fee_dynamics` plus `elapsed_seconds`, a corpus-position signal.

`core_fee_dynamics` selects safe fee, gas-pressure, local trend, cadence/calendar, rolling log-fee, and tx-count outputs. It does not include priority-fee, elapsed-time/corpus-position, raw block author/proposer, or same-block finalized gas/tx outputs.

Feature YAML files remain explicit operator specs. Each registered feature catalog owns its expected output tuple and fingerprint source files; tests keep YAML and catalog ownership aligned.

Problems:

- `current_row_nominal`: `observed_time_window` with `slot_spacing.id: nominal`.
- `current_row_recent_median`: same compiler with `slot_spacing.id: recent_median`.

Training uses fixed internal sequence preparation. `training.sequence.min_length` and
`training.sequence.max_length` bound the derived context length.

Evaluators: `poisson_replay`. Evaluate workflows select an evaluator explicitly.

Benchmarks: `priority_fee_ablation`, `safe_baseline_grid`, `large_capacity_hpo`, `lookback_window_sweep`, `slot_spacing_sweep`, `elapsed_position_ablation`, and `delay_degradation_sweep`.

`safe_baseline_grid` is the untuned ETH/POL/AVAX by LSTM/Transformer/Transformer-LSTM baseline. `large_capacity_hpo` is the bounded calibration search: the same 3x3 grid, conservative large-capacity spaces, and 32 trials per cell. `lookback_window_sweep`, `slot_spacing_sweep`, `elapsed_position_ablation`, and `delay_degradation_sweep` are fixed train/evaluate grids, not per-cell HPO grids. `delay_degradation_sweep` trains one artifact per `max_delay_seconds` value and evaluates with the artifact capability delay unless an evaluate step sets `delay_seconds`. Sample-count sweeps are deferred because larger history windows need explicit date-range and protocol-regime checks.

## Invariants

Config ids name concrete specs. Surface fields point at existing specs. Training
and tuning select checkpoints by validation `total_loss`. Estimated-block
runnable paths are archived, not available as current configs.
