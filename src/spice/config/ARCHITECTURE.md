# Config Architecture

## Purpose

`config` turns human-facing YAML and CLI selections into typed runtime configs. It is the edge where names become objects. Downstream code should receive explicit, resolved config models instead of resolving strings again.

## Mental Model

```text
surface YAML + workflow selection
          |
          v
surface frame with selection overrides
          |
          v
named YAML groups loaded from conf/
          |
          v
owner coercers rebuild concrete nested configs
          |
          v
AcquireConfig / TrainConfig / TuneConfig / EvaluateConfig
```

Configuration has two jobs:

```text
composition  choose named pieces and apply selection overrides
validation   turn those pieces into typed models with clear errors
```

Concrete config models inherit the shared strict `core.config_model.ConfigModel` base. The config package and owner packages own their fields and coercers; `core` only owns the generic Pydantic policy.

The config package should not train models, evaluate predictions, acquire blocks, or write artifacts. It resolves intent.

## Workflow Selection

A workflow selection is unresolved workflow intent. CLI commands build selections from user-facing choices, and benchmark materialization may build them internally while producing durable plan entries. Resolution applies the selection to a surface, then loads named config groups and owner coercers to produce a workflow config.

Selections usually refer to problem specs by name. Benchmark problem grids may supply an inline `ProblemSpec`; this still uses the same resolution path, and the resolved workflow config stores the full executable problem.

## Config Group Loading

Config groups have two loading interfaces. `groups.load_named_group_payload()` returns a canonical raw dict for CLI show/edit, templates, fixture mutation, benchmark raw specs, and durable YAML output. `typed_registry` exposes group-specific typed loaders for workflow resolution and other internal runtime setup.

`groups` owns named group lookup and identity checks. Owner packages own concrete dispatch inside a group. Tuning-space loading stays in resolution because it depends on the selected model and problem. Benchmark typed loading stays in benchmarks.

`selection_application` owns the surface-only step that loads a named surface and applies acquire/train/tune selection overrides. `surfaces` owns frame models only.

## Owner Coercion

Generic Pydantic validation cannot always reconstruct concrete nested types. The owning package knows which selector maps to which concrete type:

```text
evaluation.id            -> evaluation config type
dataset_builder.id       -> dataset-builder config type
model.id                 -> model-family config type
problem.compiler.id      -> problem compiler config type
problem.execution_policy.id   -> execution-policy config type
training.input_normalization.id -> input-normalization config type
objective.id             -> objective config shape
```

So config group typed loading, resolved snapshot hydration, and typed tuned-parameter transforms call owner coercers. Config-facing coercer envelope errors normalize to `ConfigResolutionError`. Owner tables stay in their packages; `core.specs` only supplies mechanical helpers for payload/id extraction, concrete-type validation, and compile-time type assertions.

A Concrete Owner Config is the concrete local-spec config selected by an owner id. Owner coercers preserve identity only for Concrete Owner Config instances. Abstract typed selector configs are redispatched by id and validated as the concrete type before runtime code sees them. This keeps all implementation-selection knowledge in the owning domain.

## Surface Resolution

Surface resolution is the fresh path from Workflow Selection to Workflow Config. It applies selection overrides, loads named config groups, calls owner coercers, and instantiates `AcquireConfig`, `TrainConfig`, `TuneConfig`, or `EvaluateConfig` from already typed pieces.

Surface resolution does not hydrate raw resolved snapshots. Resolved snapshots are already past selection and surface ownership.

## Resolved Workflow Hydration

Remote execution and benchmark run persistence do not re-resolve surfaces. They serialize or load an already resolved config snapshot:

```text
resolved Train/Tune/Evaluate config
        |
        v
workflow_config_snapshot_json()
        |
        v
remote runner or benchmark plan JSONL
        |
        v
hydrate_workflow_config_snapshot()
        |
        v
owner coercers reconstruct concrete nested configs
```

Resolved Workflow Hydration is intentionally snapshot-only. It supports train, tune, and evaluate. Acquire has different acquisition/provider concerns and is resolved through Surface resolution.

Tuned-parameter application is a typed transform. It rebuilds `TrainConfig` or `TuneConfig` from validated concrete nested configs and does not call snapshot hydration.

## Public API Boundary

`spice.config` exports resolved config types, workflow selection types, `resolve_workflow_config()`, `resolve_workflow_command_config()`, workflow snapshot codecs, and config-owned coercers such as `coerce_problem_spec()` and `coerce_features_config()`.

The generic `ConfigModel` base is intentionally not a public `spice.config` export. Modules that define config models import it from `spice.core.config_model`.

It does not re-export dataset-builder coercion. Dataset-builder config coercion belongs to `spice.modeling.dataset_builders`.

## Default Remote Target

The CLI owns the convenience default:

```text
DEFAULT_REMOTE_TARGET = "disi_l40"
```

Resolved configs and execution APIs do not carry a hidden fallback target. Submitted commands pass an explicit target name downstream.

## Extension Points

Add a public config group when users need to name, inspect, or edit that spec. Add a workflow selection field only when it is legitimate unresolved workflow intent or runtime control. Add concrete implementation selection in the owner package, not in config.
