# Concrete Config Resolution

Config resolution turns small named YAML fragments into fully typed workflow configs. The concrete implementation is strict: every local spec is validated against the model for its own group entry before workflow code sees it.

## Mental Model

The repository separates three concepts:

```text
authored YAML
  -> resolved mapping
  -> typed Pydantic model
  -> compiled runtime contract
```

YAML is user-facing. Pydantic models are the internal boundary. Concrete config models inherit the strict `core.config_model.ConfigModel` base; implementation packages own their fields and owner coercers. Compiled contracts are executable objects used by modeling, acquisition, and evaluation.

A Concrete Owner Config is the concrete local-spec config selected by an owner id. Owner coercers may preserve that object by identity. Abstract typed selector configs are redispatched by id and validated against the concrete type before runtime modules receive them.

## Local Specs

Local specs are small named configs such as `model/lstm.yaml`, `problem/current_row_nominal.yaml`, `evaluator/poisson_replay.yaml`, and reusable `evaluations/*.yaml` suites.

Config Group Loading has two explicit paths:

```text
groups.load_named_group_payload()
  -> canonical raw dict for show/edit/template/benchmark raw specs

typed_groups.load(typed_groups.MODEL, name), typed_groups.load(typed_groups.PROBLEM, name), ...
  -> direct document load and typed owner config for resolution/runtime callers
```

Resolution uses the same typed pattern across context-free named groups:

```text
workflow-shaped ref
  -> typed group loader
  -> owner coercer when the group has concrete implementations
  -> typed config
```

This gives concrete implementations one owner. For example, the evaluation package owns evaluator config models, and the modeling package owns dataset-builder config models.

## Surface Resolution

A surface is a named bundle of config choices. Surface application turns it into workflow-shaped refs:

```text
surface: current_row_fee_dynamics
overrides: model=lstm, delay_seconds=36

        surface YAML
             |
             v
  chain/corpus/provider/problem
  features/model/prediction
  evaluations/training/split
             |
             v
      workflow config model
```

Fresh resolution applies acquire/train/tune selections to the Surface inside `resolution.py` and constructs the workflow config directly from typed pieces. Evaluate remains root-id based and does not use surface composition. The result is a typed acquire, train, tune, or evaluate config.

Surface resolution is a typed construction path. Once named groups and overrides have been resolved, `resolution.py` instantiates the workflow config from typed pieces. It does not round-trip through raw resolved snapshot hydration.

Selection overrides are explicit: only `None` means “use the surface value.”
Empty strings and other invalid refs are carried into typed loading and fail as
bad references.

Workflow Command Selection lives at the CLI edge. Workflow commands construct typed `WorkflowSelection` models from operator options, then call `resolve_workflow_config()` to produce concrete workflow configs. Benchmarks construct typed selections inside benchmark materialization before using the same fresh resolution path.

## Resolved Workflow Hydration

Resolved snapshot hydration is the raw-payload path for already materialized train, tune, and evaluate configs. It validates the snapshot workflow marker, then uses owner coercers to rebuild concrete nested configs.

`resolved_workflows.py` owns final resolved workflow field sets, evaluate defaults, and assembly into train, tune, and evaluate configs. Fresh resolution and snapshot hydration both call that module after they have produced typed resolved fields.

Acquire is excluded from snapshot hydration. Acquire configs contain provider/acquisition concerns and are produced through surface resolution.

Tuned-parameter application is not snapshot hydration. It is a typed train/tune config transform that applies tuned params through owner-family validators and rebuilds the workflow config directly.

Model workflow snapshots contain training/evaluation fields: chain, corpus,
problem, model, features, prediction, storage, artifact, split, training, study,
tuning, and tuning space depending on workflow. Evaluate snapshots also contain
evaluator and evaluation-window controls.

Evaluation windows use UTC timestamp ranges:

```text
evaluation.start
  -> scored_start: UTC timestamp
  -> scored_end: scored_start + duration_seconds
  -> required context and outcome rows remain internal
```

## Evaluation Rules

Training and tuning select checkpoints by validation `total_loss`. Evaluate
workflow compiles the selected evaluator and stores an immutable Evaluation Config
Snapshot under the artifact state DB.

## Config Boundary Errors

Config-facing errors are reported as `ConfigResolutionError`. This keeps YAML mistakes distinct from runtime data errors.

Typical failures:

| Failure | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown spec id | A YAML reference names no checked-in spec. |
| Wrong local config type | A spec was routed to a compiler that does not own it. |
| Extra fields | The YAML contains fields not accepted by that concrete config. |
| Missing owner id | Registry dispatch cannot choose an implementation. |

## CLI Remote Target Boundary

The CLI command layer owns the default remote target:

```text
spice train
  -> target defaults to disi_l40
  -> execution config resolves explicitly
  -> downstream submit receives target name
```

Execution and transfer code do not guess a remote target. That keeps command ergonomics centralized and lower layers deterministic.

## Extension Pattern

To add a concrete config type, subclass the shared config base in the package that owns the implementation, register the local spec id, and make the compiler require that concrete model. The config package should resolve names and load resolved workflow snapshots; implementation packages should own implementation-specific fields.
