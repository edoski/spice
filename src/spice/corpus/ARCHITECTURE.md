# Corpus Architecture

## Purpose

`corpus` owns canonical block data and coverage checks. It is the boundary between raw acquisition output and downstream ML feature construction.

## Corpus Identity

Corpus identity is durable data identity:

```text
chain + dataset name + evaluation date -> corpus id
```

It does not include model, prediction, objective, evaluator, or artifact settings. It also does not include the incidental acquisition window. Acquisition windows are provenance for a run; corpus identity is the named canonical dataset context.

## Acquisition To Corpus Flow

```text
provider/RPC blocks
  |
  v
canonical block rows
  |
  v
history and evaluation parquet datasets
  |
  v
dataset manifest + acquire run record
  |
  v
corpus root state
```

External uncertainty enters through acquisition: provider failures, missing blocks, latency, and chain-specific payload details. Corpus validation resolves those concerns before feature construction starts.

## Corpus Assembly

Corpus Assembly owns acquisition-to-corpus orchestration. It builds a Corpus Capability Planning context, asks it for history/evaluation window and refill decisions, delegates staging/fulfillment/commit mechanics to Corpus Acquisition Stage, builds dataset provenance, and returns the committed corpus result.

Corpus Capability Planning owns feature/problem contract compilation for acquisition coverage, Corpus Acquisition Source Requirements, initial history sizing, valid temporal capability sample counting, and bounded refill policy. Optional raw-source policy, such as priority-fee history fields, is derived there from the feature contract before the acquire workflow constructs a concrete block source. Corpus Acquisition Stage owns acquire staging paths, materialization session lifecycle, history refill sequencing, evaluation fulfillment, state DB staging, partial commit wiring, successful cleanup, and preserve-on-failure behavior. Corpus Split Materialization fulfills Split Intents and owns staged/committed fact collection, target matching, internal materialization policy, pull execution, chunk writing, and validation of history/evaluation parquet datasets. Extension paths reuse whole clean parquet chunks and materialize only missing or edge block ranges.

The acquire workflow supplies a Workflow Config, resolved paths, and a block source configured with corpus-derived source requirements. It does not know feature-source policy, capability planning, split materialization, refill, staging, or publication ordering.

## Coverage Checks

Training and evaluation workflows ask corpus coverage whether the stored block windows satisfy the temporal problem and feature prerequisites.

```text
dataset manifest
  + feature prerequisites
  + temporal problem coverage requirement
  -> pass/fail before model work starts
```

This prevents expensive training or evaluation from running on a corpus that cannot support the requested examples.

## Boundaries

Corpus code should not know about model families, evaluator adapters, objectives, or artifact variants. Corpus Capability Planning may compile feature/problem contracts only to prove raw corpus coverage during acquisition.
