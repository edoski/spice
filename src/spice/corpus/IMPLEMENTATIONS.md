# Concrete Corpus Implementation

The corpus layer owns canonical blockchain data: how raw RPC block payloads become parquet rows, how rows are validated, and how enough history is proven before modeling.

## Mental Model

A corpus is split into history and evaluation data:

```text
history rows
  -> fit features, build training/validation/test examples

evaluation rows
  -> run diagnostic replay for the evaluation day
```

The dataset identity is based on dataset name, chain, and evaluation date. It is not based on the exact acquisition window.

## Canonical Block Schema

Every row uses the same columns:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `block_number` | Chain block height. |
| `timestamp` | Block timestamp in seconds. |
| `base_fee_per_gas` | EIP-1559 base fee value. |
| `gas_used` | Gas consumed in the block. |
| `chain_id` | Numeric chain id. |
| `gas_limit` | Block gas limit. |

RPC payload conversion builds this schema. Missing required block fields fail during conversion. Missing `base_fee_per_gas` becomes `0`, which keeps canonical rows rectangular for chains or blocks where the field is absent.

## Parquet IO

Corpus IO is parquet-only. Data is stored as chunk files under history and evaluation directories:

```text
corpus root/
  history/
    ethereum__blocks__START_to_END.parquet
  evaluation/
    ethereum__blocks__START_to_END.parquet
```

Loads scan recursively, skip hidden paths, combine chunks, and sort by `block_number`. Sorting gives deterministic row order even when chunks were written in several parts.

## Validation

Validation answers two questions:

1. Is this a clean contiguous block range?
2. Does this range cover the requested timestamps?

Contiguous validation checks:

| Check | Failure meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Non-empty frame | No block data exists. |
| Required columns | Data is not canonical. |
| One chain id | Mixed chain rows. |
| Adjacent block numbers differ by `1` | Gap or duplicate block range. |
| Timestamps can be coerced | Invalid time data. |

Exact-window validation also counts rows before `start` and rows at or after `end`.

## Coverage

Coverage connects corpus rows to modeling needs. A clean block range is not enough; the model also needs enough warmup and enough future horizon.

```text
feature prerequisites
  + problem prerequisites
  + sample count
  + max delay
  -> required corpus coverage
```

Training coverage requires history seconds plus max delay seconds, and warmup rows plus requested sample count. Evaluation coverage requires enough history before the evaluation window and enough evaluation span for the delay.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Typical cause |
| --- | --- |
| Empty frame | Acquisition produced no rows. |
| Chain mismatch | Wrong provider or mixed files. |
| Duplicate/gapped blocks | Interrupted or corrupt corpus materialization. |
| Evaluation rows outside window | Wrong date or wrong range resolution. |
| Insufficient history seconds | Feature/problem warmup cannot be met. |
| Insufficient history rows | Requested sample count cannot be built. |
| Delay exceeds capability | Evaluation asks for a horizon the trained artifact cannot support. |

## Extension Pattern

New corpus sources should still emit the canonical block schema and pass the same validation reports. Acquisition method can vary; corpus semantics should not.
