# Modeling Architecture

## Purpose

`modeling` owns sequence preparation, model-family construction, CUDA training,
forward inference, model-bound scoring, artifact assembly, and runtime result
objects. It bridges temporal examples and neural network execution.

## Training Flow

```text
TrainConfig
  |
  v
build_artifact_training_spec() / build_trial_training_spec()
  |
  +--> feature contract
  +--> problem contract
  +--> prediction contract
  |
  v
fixed sequence preparation
  |
  v
build model via model-family registry
  |
  v
run_training_fit()
  |
  v
write artifact payloads into storage-provided staged root
```

Training is CUDA-only. `training_runner.run_training_fit()` keeps SPICE's fit
policy and delegates the epoch host loop to Lightning. Lightning owns `fit`; SPICE
still owns optimizer settings, loss computation, metric accumulation, validation
total-loss selection, finite-metric policy, best-state restore, callbacks, and
split metrics.

## Evaluation Flow

```text
loaded artifact
  |
  v
Artifact Inference Context
  |
  +--> validate artifact semantics
  +--> validate corpus coverage
  +--> reconstruct fixed sequence preparation from artifact metadata
  |
  v
EvaluationScoringRuntimePlan
  |
  v
score_evaluation(scoring_plan, evaluator_contract)
  |
  +--> score model into decoded result
  +--> evaluator.run()
  |
  v
EvaluationSummary
```

Serving can use a CPU runtime plan. Training, tuning, and evaluation use CUDA.

## Runtime Model

`ModelingRuntimePlan` carries resolved device, precision, batch runtime context,
determinism, and seed. Precision is fixed to `32-true`. Batch planning always uses
streaming host `DataLoader`s, deterministic position grouping, optional batch-level
shuffle for training, pinned host memory when CUDA is available, and explicit
per-batch device transfer.

There is no runtime memory probing, CUDA-resident batch storage, CPU train/eval
fallback, or `torch.compile` branch. Those policies were removed to keep the
runtime direct and predictable on the intended L40 CUDA environment.

## Extension Points

Add a model family for a new neural architecture. Add prediction or evaluator
behavior in their owning packages. Do not add a new public sequence builder,
representation registry, or input-normalization selector without a new design pass.
