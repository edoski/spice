# Modeling Architecture

## Purpose

`modeling` owns tensorization, model-family construction, training loops, inference, scoring, trained artifact assembly, runtime training/evaluation result objects, and model-bound scoring.

It is the bridge between generic temporal examples and neural network execution.

## Training Flow

```text
TrainConfig
  |
  v
build_artifact_training_spec() / build_trial_training_spec()
  |
  +--> feature contract
  +--> problem contract
  +--> prediction contract
  +--> objective runtime
  +--> dataset-builder contract
  +--> input-normalization contract
  |
  v
Temporal Dataset Preparation Interface
  |
  v
build model family
  |
  v
run_training_fit()
  |
  v
persist artifact state
```

The model family is only one part of learning. The same model architecture can learn a different task if the prediction family changes. The same prediction task can use a different model family if model config changes.

## Evaluation/Scoring Flow

```text
loaded artifact
  |
  v
Artifact Inference Context
  |
  +--> validate artifact semantics
  +--> validate corpus coverage
  +--> call Temporal Dataset Preparation Interface
  |
  v
ModelScoringInput
  +--> prepared store
  +--> representation/prediction/execution/evaluation contracts
  +--> scoring runtime plan
  |
  v
score_evaluation(model_input, evaluator_contract)
  |
  +--> evaluator checks accepted decoded-result id
  +--> predict_with_model()
  +--> evaluator.run()
  |
  v
EvaluationSummary
```

Artifact inference validation is centralized in `modeling.artifact_inference`. It turns an active evaluate workflow config plus a trained artifact into trusted scoring inputs, then delegates tensorization state reconstruction to the Temporal Dataset Preparation Interface. Evaluator execution stays in `modeling.scoring` when model inference is involved.

Artifact training and temporary tuning trials use separate training-spec entrypoints so artifact identity and study identity stay explicit at the workflow seam.

Tuning Execution is centralized in `modeling.tuning_execution`. It opens compatible study state, validates resume counts, runs Optuna trials in temporary artifact directories, records trial metadata, and returns storage-owned study summaries. Workflows only resolve roots, validate coverage, attach reporter callbacks, and reindex.

## Dataset Builders

Dataset builders adapt canonical block frames into model-ready training and inference datasets. They own tensorization policy, split behavior, builder runtime metadata, scaler fitting inputs, and inference-time reconstruction from the artifact Temporal Capability. They do not own corpus IO, feature semantics, prediction losses, or evaluator metrics.
Callers provide domain facts such as split, delay, and evaluation window plus compiled/trusted context; builders decide how those facts become samples and tensors.

```text
raw/canonical blocks
    |
    v
builder-local frame preparation
    |
    v
feature table
    |
    v
problem store + Temporal Capability
    |
    v
prepared dataset + builder runtime metadata
```

Shared dataset-builder abstractions should remove real duplication without hiding sample-ordering, split, candidate-window, or empty-frame policy.

## Extension Points

Add a model family for a new neural architecture. Add a dataset builder for a new tensorization strategy. Add scoring behavior only when it is generic model-to-evaluator bridging; evaluator-specific scoring belongs in `evaluation`.

Runtime planning is intentionally split from fit policy. A `RepresentationRuntimeContext` carries a `DeviceStorageBudget`, which names whether CUDA-resident batch storage is disabled, coarse, or measured. Forward scoring and training both perform a host warmup before final batch planning, but training owns the destructive gradient-bearing probe and model-state restoration. Batch planning consumes the budget and caller-prepared temporal facts or Action Space; it does not prepare policy facts, measure CUDA memory, or revalidate selected-sample alignment. `training_runner.py` remains the public fit interface and keeps callback, best-state, and result assembly ownership.
