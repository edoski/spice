# Model Families Architecture

## Purpose

`modeling.families` owns concrete neural network architectures and their model-family config models. The generic strict config base lives in `core.config_model`, and generic runtime contracts live in `modeling.models`.

## Theory

A model family defines the function approximator. It does not define the prediction target. This separation lets an LSTM, transformer, or hybrid model train against the same prediction family contract.

## Invariants

Families construct models from typed configs, model input width, and prediction output specs. They should not receive representation contracts, resolve YAML, read storage, compute evaluator metrics, or build prediction target batches.

Each family module owns its concrete PyTorch class. Shared implementation exists only for real repeated architecture rules: output heads, final-valid sequence selection, and Transformer encoder validation/building. `models.py` does not import family implementations.

## Extension Points

Add a family for a new architecture. Keep model-specific hyperparameters in the family config and tune-space config, not in generic training config.

## Beginner Context

An LSTM, transformer, or hybrid architecture is a way to transform input tensors into output tensors. It should not decide which target is correct or which fee metric matters. Those decisions belong to prediction and evaluation.

## Hyperparameter Boundary

Model-family config owns architectural hyperparameters such as hidden size, dropout, layers, or attention dimensions. Training config owns optimizer and loop behavior such as learning rate, epochs, batch size, and early stopping.

Config-facing model-family coercion normalizes invalid payload envelopes to `ConfigResolutionError` and returns already typed model configs unchanged.

## Model Family Registry

Family registration owns config coercion, model construction, tuning-space dispatch, tuned-parameter application, tuning validation hooks, and tunable field specs.

Generic tuning code samples declared categorical fields and applies tuned params by validated config copy through this boundary. Family modules keep architecture rules that are not generic, such as Transformer attention constraints and `feedforward_multiplier` derivation.
