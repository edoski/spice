# Objectives Architecture

## Purpose

`objectives` defines what optimization and tuning should maximize or minimize.

## Theory

An objective can be a validation metric from the training loop or a benchmark metric from evaluator scoring. Separating objective selection from prediction and evaluation lets you train one prediction task while tuning for a decision-quality metric.

## Invariants

Validation objectives read validation metrics directly and do not request scoring context. Evaluation objectives declare the benchmark metric to optimize. Objective configs must match the selected evaluation when they benchmark an evaluator, and their direction must match the evaluator metric descriptor when the descriptor declares a direction. Model-bound metric production belongs to the **Objective Runtime** in `modeling.objective_runtime`.

Objective contracts consume the shared metric ABI from `spice.metrics`; they do not own metric result shapes.

## Extension Points

Add an objective type when optimization policy changes. Do not put evaluator execution in objectives or tuning code; route model-bound metric production through Modeling.

## Objective Flow

```text
training epoch
    |
    +--> validation metrics --------+
    |                               |
    +--> Objective Runtime ----------+
                                    |
                                    v
                              objective metric
                                    |
                                    v
                         early stopping / tuning direction
```

## Beginner Context

The objective is the scalar value used to compare model states or tuning trials. A metric can be useful for diagnostics without being the objective. For example, an evaluator may report many economic metrics, but tuning needs one primary metric and one direction.

## Evaluation Objective Boundary

Objectives are policy-only: metric id, direction, benchmark binding, and semantics. Evaluation-backed objective metrics use `modeling.objective_runtime`, which receives the already compiled evaluator contract and calls `modeling.scoring` for the generic sequence:

```text
check decoded-result id -> predict -> evaluate -> return metrics
```

This keeps Optuna and training loops from knowing evaluator internals.

Config-facing objective coercion normalizes invalid payload envelopes to `ConfigResolutionError` and returns already typed objective configs unchanged.
