# Storage Architecture

## Purpose

`storage` owns deterministic identity, canonical path layout, root-local SQLite state, catalog records, root lifecycle mechanics, inspection, deletion, and the remote-side sync helper.

ML artifacts need provenance. A model file without its dataset, features, temporal problem, prediction contract, evaluator config, and training config is hard to trust. Spice stores authoritative state inside each root and keeps a separate catalog for discovery.

## Root Layout

```text
outputs/
  .spice/catalog.sqlite
  corpora/<chain>/<corpus_id>/.spice/state.sqlite
  studies/<chain>/<study_id>/.spice/state.sqlite
  artifacts/<chain>/<artifact_id>/.spice/state.sqlite
```

Root-local state is authoritative. The catalog is an index that can be rebuilt by scanning roots.

## Root Kinds

```text
RootKind.CORPUS    canonical block data
RootKind.STUDY     tuning/search state
RootKind.ARTIFACT  trained model and evaluation state
```

Every state database stores root-kind metadata. Read APIs validate root kind before interpreting a database as a corpus, study, or artifact root. A table name alone is not sufficient proof that a database belongs to the expected domain.

Malformed persisted payloads raise `StateLayoutError`. Missing expected state raises `MissingStateError`.

## Commit Patterns

```text
train / transfer pull complete root
  write complete staged root
  -> validate staged root kind
  -> atomically promote root
  -> reindex catalog

acquire partial corpus update
  write staged history/evaluation/state files
  -> atomically replace selected paths
  -> reindex corpus root

tune / evaluate existing roots
  mutate root-local state directly
  -> reindex only when search records/materialized state change
```

`PartialRootCommit` always replaces selected paths. Full root staging keeps explicit `replace` behavior because push/pull operations expose overwrite policy.

## Identity Rule

Ids hash provenance, not paths:

```text
semantic provenance -> canonical payload -> deterministic id
```

Output location should not change corpus, study, or artifact identity. Run controls that do not affect durable semantics, such as tuning trial limits, should not change study identity.

Catalog `created_at` is stable across upserts. `updated_at` changes when a record is refreshed.

## Module Map

```text
storage/
  layout.py          canonical paths
  identity.py        provenance payload assembly
  ids.py             deterministic id hashing
  engine.py          SQLite engine and root-kind metadata
  schema.py          root-local state schema
  selectors.py       typed catalog selectors
  payloads.py        generic payload stores/codecs
  artifact_codecs.py artifact-root payload ABI
  semantics_codecs.py persisted semantic-contract payload ABI
  corpus.py          corpus-root persistence
  study_manifest.py  study-root manifest persistence
  study_models.py    study payload models/codecs
  study_optuna.py    Optuna storage integration
  artifact.py        artifact-root persistence
  workflow_paths.py  workflow config to storage-path resolution
  lifecycle.py       staging, promotion, partial commit, delete cascade
  sync_cli.py        remote-side path/root-kind helper commands
  inspect*.py        read-only inspection views
  catalog/           global searchable index and refresh service
```

Storage owns persisted payload ABI. Modeling and evaluation own runtime result objects; storage codecs translate those objects at the SQLite table boundary.

## Remote Transfer Boundary

Remote SSH and rsync orchestration lives in `execution.transfer`. Storage only exposes local lifecycle/catalog operations and `storage.sync_cli`, the helper module executed on the remote machine for path and root-kind operations.
