# Storage Architecture

## Purpose

`storage` owns deterministic identity, canonical path layout, root-local SQLite state, catalog records, root lifecycle mechanics, inspection, deletion, and the remote-side transfer helper.

ML artifacts need provenance. A model file without its dataset, features, temporal problem, prediction contract, evaluator config, and training config is hard to trust. Spice stores authoritative state inside each root and keeps a separate catalog for discovery.

## Root Layout

```text
outputs/
  .spice/catalog.sqlite
  corpora/<chain>/<corpus_id>/.spice/state.sqlite
  studies/<chain>/<study_id>/.spice/state.sqlite
  artifacts/<chain>/<artifact_id>/.spice/state.sqlite
```

Root-local state is authoritative. The catalog is an index that can be rebuilt by scanning roots.

## Root Kinds

```text
RootKind.CORPUS    canonical block data
RootKind.STUDY     tuning/search state
RootKind.ARTIFACT  trained model and evaluation state
```

Every state database stores root-kind metadata. Read APIs validate root kind before interpreting a database as a corpus, study, or artifact root. A table name alone is not sufficient proof that a database belongs to the expected domain.

Malformed persisted payloads raise `StateLayoutError`. Missing expected state raises `MissingStateError`.

## Commit Patterns

```text
train / transfer pull complete root
  write complete staged root
  -> validate staged root kind
  -> atomically promote root
  -> reindex catalog

acquire partial corpus update
  write staged history/evaluation/state files
  -> atomically replace selected paths
  -> reindex corpus root

tune existing study root
  mutate root-local search state
  -> validate study root kind
  -> reindex study root

evaluate existing artifact root
  record evaluation state
  -> keep catalog unchanged because artifact catalog rows derive from manifest
```

`storage.transactions` owns workflow-facing commit and mutation entrypoints. Public callers pass root handles plus staged sources or writer/mutation callbacks; storage derives root kind, destination paths, prune policy, selected-path replacement, promotion, validation, and reindex behavior internally. `workflow_roots.py` carries root handles only; it does not own promotion, reindex, or evaluation-state mutation policy.

## Identity Rule

Ids hash provenance, not paths:

```text
semantic provenance -> canonical payload -> deterministic id
```

Output location should not change corpus, study, or artifact identity. Run controls that do not affect durable semantics, such as tuning trial limits, should not change study identity.

Catalog `created_at` is stable across upserts. `updated_at` changes when a record is refreshed.

Storage owns persisted payload ABI. Modeling and evaluation own runtime result objects; named storage `PayloadCodec` objects translate those objects at the SQLite table boundary. Persistence modules call codec objects directly, keeping encode/decode locality at one seam per persisted record type. Corpus manifests and acquire runs are Pydantic-native durable records, while artifact and study codecs keep explicit storage records where the persisted shape differs from the runtime object. Artifact manifests persist Temporal Capability as the artifact-facing compiler capability bundle and persist artifact semantics as its normalized semantic projection; `storage.artifact_codecs` owns the nested capability payload envelope and calls temporal compiler metadata dispatch at that storage seam. Artifact evaluation state stores an **Evaluation Config Snapshot**, not a live evaluator config object, so evaluation storage identity is based on immutable evaluator provenance.

Producer identity and consumer selection stay separate inside `storage.workflow_root_materialization`. That module resolves existing roots through the catalog, derives produced root ids, materializes consumed/produced/source scalar root facts, and assembles workflow root sets. `workflow_roots.py` owns handle models and read behavior; existing-root handle locations come from `storage.catalog.materialization`. Root handles expose root facts and manifest loading. Storage transactions expose handle-shaped staging and mutation helpers to workflows while keeping root-kind, prune, promotion, selected-path commit, existing-root mutation, and reindex policy inside storage; lower-level lifecycle remains path and root-kind infrastructure. Benchmark Plan Materialization asks Storage Root Materialization for scalar facts; benchmark ledger shape stays benchmark-owned.

`operator.py` owns Storage Operator Outcomes for show/delete command behavior: list-vs-detail selection, detail ambiguity, narrowing attributes, delete-blocked diagnostics, and refresh rendering. CLI code maps options to selectors, maps narrowing attributes to flag names, and prints renderable sections.

## Remote Transfer Boundary

Remote SSH and rsync orchestration lives in `execution.transfer_transaction`. Storage exposes local lifecycle/catalog operations, artifact dependency inspection warnings, and `storage.sync_cli`, the helper module executed on the remote machine for path and root-kind operations. `storage.sync_cli finalize-stage` emits the promoted catalog record through the strict remote catalog envelope.

Catalog kind `dataset` maps intentionally to storage `RootKind.CORPUS`: corpus is the operator/config identity, while corpus is the physical storage root kind. `storage.catalog.index` owns typed catalog list/resolve/upsert/reindex operations, private catalog dispatch owns root-kind metadata, `storage.catalog.materialization` owns canonical destination paths and record construction, and `storage.catalog.codecs` owns the strict remote JSON envelope used by transfer helpers.
