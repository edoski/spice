# Workflows Architecture

## Purpose

`workflows` orchestrates application tasks: acquire, train, tune, and evaluate. A workflow connects generic services in the correct order, validates preconditions, reports progress, and commits outputs.

It should not own implementation details from feature families, prediction families, model families, evaluator engines, or storage internals.

## Boundary Rule

```text
resolved typed config
        |
        v
workflow
        |
        +--> contracts and services
        +--> storage layout/staging primitives
        +--> reporter messages
```

Workflows receive typed configs. They do not resolve remote target defaults. They do not branch on concrete evaluator or prediction implementation ids.

## Acquire

```text
AcquireConfig
  -> resolve provider and corpus paths
  -> acquire/validate history data
  -> acquire/validate evaluation data
  -> write dataset state in temp root
  -> PartialRootCommit selected files
  -> reindex corpus root
```

Acquire stays mostly together because it is a stable orchestration around RPC block acquisition. Storage commit clutter belongs in storage primitives; tiny private phase helpers are fine when they clarify the orchestration.

## Train

```text
TrainConfig
  -> optionally apply best tuned params
  -> resolve paths
  -> build training spec
  -> validate corpus coverage
  -> staged artifact root
  -> persisted training
  -> validate/promote artifact root
  -> report result
```

Train uses complete-root staging because it produces a full artifact root.

## Tune

```text
TuneConfig
  -> build objective/training specs
  -> validate corpus coverage
  -> materialize or update study state
  -> run trials
  -> reindex study root after materialization
```

Tune mutates study state rather than staging an entire root for each trial.

## Evaluate

```text
EvaluateConfig
  -> load artifact
  -> prepare inference dataset
  -> score model with evaluator through modeling.scoring
  -> upsert evaluation state
  -> report result
```

Evaluate appends or updates artifact state. It does not stage a full artifact root.

## Extension Points

Add workflow code only for task-level orchestration. If logic is reusable and domain-specific, put it in the owning package first, then call it from the workflow.
